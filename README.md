<h3>About this app!</h3>
This is a Magic the Gathering gameboard for the commander format. It is designed to give a better play experience to fellow wizards of the game. I know when ive been playing games of commander its hard to keep track of what commander your friends are playing and end up having to reach over the table or constantly ask what does your commander do again? 

You Start at the home screen where you can either jump into a game by selecting how many players. Or you can create a user profile choosing a username. next you can go to your profile and add all of your commanders to your profile that will be displayed at the bottom. From your profile you can also edit your profile or delete profiles. Now when you go back to the homescreen and select how many players you will be able to use the dropdown menus to select your username and then the second dropdown will have a list of your commanders. If you dont have a profile you can just simply enter in your commander.  

The intent of this application is to have it on a big screen while you play that shows your commander and also keeps track of life total and commander damage. I also included a dice rolling component that you can roll a 6 sides and 20 sided die and also be able to flip a coin.

lastly I included a card search thats handy to use when you are trying to find a particular card. You just need to know a partial of the card and it will bring up anything thats close. 

<h3>Details</h3>
For this application I used javascript, React, express, Node and a postgress database. The database contains two tables one for user information (username, firstname). The second is for user deck information which has a relationship with users and also if you delete a user from the users table it will also remove any deck information from that user. 

<h3>API</h3>
I am using a already created api https://scryfall.com/docs/api for card information such as imagaes and commander information

<h3>More information</h3>
This is my capstone project for my coding bootcamp. I cant wait to keep adding to this as I use it for my own commander games and come up with more ideas.
