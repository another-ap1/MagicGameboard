I am building a magic the gethering gameboard that I hope to have more features than the ones that are already out there. This is also my capstone project for my coding bootcamp. 

I am using my own API for the users and decks and their relationship with eachother. And I am using a already created api https://scryfall.com/docs/api for card information such as imagaes and commander information
