Capstone Project Ideas!

Magic the Gathering Game Board
    my first idea is to create a magic the gethering gameboard that would keep track of the game
    status while also being able to look up cards and rules of the game. it would have a gameboad and
    also individual "boards" for each player. there are a lot of different things that could happen in the 
    game and i would like to create a board that keeps track of those things. Most gameboards are pretty basic
    and i would like to build on top of those.

    maybe a log in feature that would keep track of users and what commanders they have and also wins and losses.  

    individual tracking
        keep track of health, commander damage, counters, if you are the monarch, picture of your commander as your background
        when your life gets to certain numbers it plays a sound or shows a new image. 

    Overall board state
        day or night
